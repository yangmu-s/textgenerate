# textgenerate
one LSTM model that can be used to generate new words
I must say that this model can't reach a pretty high level ,for that it just consisted of few simple layers and without attention parts .About the process for data ,i choose
the simplest way to build them .But after training we can see that even with the poor training dataset with pretty few words ,it can also generate some amazed sentense .So i guess
that's the point we get here .
